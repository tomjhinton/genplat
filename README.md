## Game

A relatively simplistic game where the player has to keep a square inside a spinning rectangle. Difficulty is added in that the controls relate to the original orientation of the rectangle so if it has spun 180 degrees up as it appears on the screen is actually down. The speed with which the rectangle moves increases the longer the player survives.
